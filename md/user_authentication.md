## Explanation of Backend Authentication Code

1. **Imports**:
   - The code imports necessary modules and classes from FastAPI, Pydantic, datetime, jose, and passlib.

2. **Constants**:
   - `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key used for encoding and decoding JWT tokens.
   - `ALGORITHM`: The encryption algorithm used for JWT tokens.
   - `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`: The duration for which an access token is valid.

3. **Database Mock**:
   - `db`: A mock database storing user information.

4. **Data Models**:
   - `Token`: Pydantic model representing a JWT token.
   - `TokenData`: Pydantic model representing token data.
   - `User`: Pydantic model representing user data.
   - `UserInDB`: Pydantic model representing user data with hashed password.

5. **Password Hashing**:
   - `pwd_context`: An instance of `CryptContext` used for password hashing.
   - `verify_password()`: Function to verify a plain text password against a hashed password.
   - `get_password_hash()`: Function to hash a plain text password.

6. **Authentication Functions**:
   - `get_user()`: Function to retrieve a user from the database by username.
   - `authenticate_user()`: Function to authenticate a user by verifying username and password.
   - `create_access_token()`: Function to create a JWT token for authentication.

7. **Dependency Functions**:
   - `get_current_user()`: Function to get the current user from the JWT token.
   - `get_current_active_user()`: Function to get the current active user (not disabled) from the JWT token.

8. **Routes**:
   - `/token`: POST route to generate an access token for authentication.
   - `/users/me/`: GET route to get details of the current user.
   - `/users/me/items`: GET route to get items owned by the current user.

9. **Main Code**:
   - The main code block includes the setup of FastAPI app, route handlers, and dependency injection functions.

10. **Hash Password Generation**:
    - A commented-out code block is present at the end of the file, which generates a hashed password for the user "tim" using the `get_password_hash()` function. This is just for demonstration purposes.

Overall, this code provides a robust backend implementation for user authentication using JWT tokens and password hashing in FastAPI. It follows best practices for security and API development.
